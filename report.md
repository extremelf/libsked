## Weekly reports
### 16-05-2022

This week we started with full power, redistributing tasks and aligning everything to 
do a speed run of the project. We all attended to the meeting for the exception of Thalisson,
Project started running with a good flow.

### 25-05-2022
Today there were OpenDays so only two members attended the meeting, point of situation is a bit unknown 
but the tasks planned were completed but there's still work to do.  
Layout related, almost all are done, nex week is intended to have them finished.
Once all layouts are fixed the backend department can work with no restrictions.
